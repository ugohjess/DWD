> **Basic Exploration:** A quick data exploration of a fictitious dvd rental store.
> 
``SELECT
  *
FROM
  dvd_rentals.language;``
-- Select is very key in exploring data.

``SELECT
  *
  FROM dvd_rentals.rental
  LIMIT 10;``
  -- Limit is a keyword used to restrict query results.

  ``SELECT
  country
  FROM dvd_rentals.country
  ORDER BY country
  LIMIT 10;``
   -- Order by is used to return an explicitly ordered output.
   
 `` SELECT
  country
  FROM dvd_rentals.country
  ORDER BY 1 DESC
  LIMIT 10;``
--Sorting for any column with numbers, dates, timestamps is done from lowest to highest or latest to earliest for date time related columns.
